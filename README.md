# Crypto Analysis and Visualization 

This project takes Crypto market data from 2014 to 2017 to create a price comparison candlestick graph, a Relative Strength Index model, 12-day and 26-day moving averages and Correlation Matric comparing the correlation coeffcients for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Dash.

## Notes for Understanding the Models
**Candlestick Graph:** <br>
* Plots the daily open, high, low and close market values.
* Green bodies indicate days where the closing price was greater than the opening price. 
* Red bodies indicate days where the closing price was less than the opening price.

**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br>
* Used to analyze overbought and oversold conditions by the magnitude of recent price changes. <br>
* For more on RSI: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp

**Moving Averages:**<br>
* Smoothes the price flucuations to help identify trends and can be used as a support or resistance indicator.<br>

**Pearson Corelation Coefficients:**<br>
* In this project, this is measuring the correlations between each coin.
* Measured as a number between -1 and 1. A value of -1 represents a perfectly negative correlation. Meaning as one value increases, the other will decrease. A value of 1 represents a perfectly positive correlation. Meaning as one value increases, the other value also increases. <br>
